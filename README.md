### 🌟 Algorithm Visualizer
Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based interactive tool that helps users visualize and better understand the inner workings of various algorithms. Built with React.js for the frontend, it provides an engaging experience with smooth animations powered by GSAP. The application is designed to be simple, intuitive, and responsive, allowing users to experiment with algorithms in real time.

## 🚀 Features

- **🔄 Interactive Visualization:** See algorithm processes unfold in real-time with visual representations of data structures.
- **💫 Smooth Animations:** Animations are implemented using GSAP to create smooth transitions and visual feedback.
- **⚙️ Customizable Inputs:** Users can input their own data sets, change algorithm parameters, and see the effect on the results.
- **📊 Multiple Algorithm Visualizations:** The tool provides visualizations for a range of algorithms, helping users understand how different algorithms work step by step.
- **📱 Responsive Design:** The app is designed to be fully responsive and accessible on all screen sizes.
