### Algorithm Visualizer
Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based interactive tool that helps users visualize and better understand the inner workings of various algorithms. Built with React.js for the frontend, it provides an engaging experience with smooth animations powered by GSAP. The application is designed to be simple, intuitive, and responsive, allowing users to experiment with algorithms in real time.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** : See algorithm processes unfold in real-time with visual representations of data structures.
- **Smooth Animations:** Animations are implemented using GSAP to create smooth transitions and visual feedback.
- **Customizable Inputs:** Users can input their own data sets, change algorithm parameters, and see the effect on the results.
- **Multiple Algorithm Visualizations: ** The tool provides visualizations for a range of algorithms, helping users understand how different algorithms work step by step.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to be fully responsive and accessible on all screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

Frontend:

- **React.js:** JavaScript library used to build the user interface with a component-based structure.
- **Material-UI:** React component library that provides pre-built components to speed up UI development.
- **GSAP:** JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations to bring the algorithms to life.

Deployment:
-**Frontend:** Hosted and deployed on Vercel.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisties

To run the project locally, you need to have the following installed:
- Node.js (with npm) for managing dependencies and running the frontend.

## 1. Clone the Repository:
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pooja1030/AlgorithmVisualizers.git
   ```
   ```bash
  cd AlgorithmVisualizers
   ```
## 2. Set Up the Frontend (React.js):

   1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
     cd frontend
   ```
    2. **Install the required dependencies:**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   3. **Start the React development server:**:
   ```bash
    npm start
   ```
The application should now be running locally at http://localhost:3000.
